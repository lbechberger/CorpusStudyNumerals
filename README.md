# CorpusStudyNumerals
Some scripts for a corpus study on numerals

count_numbers.py can be used as follows:

python count_numbers.py path/to/corpus/file.txt 100

It will plot the number of occurrences for each number from 0 to 100.
For the plots under /plots, the file eng_news_2015_3M-sentences.txt from the Leipzig corpus was used.
